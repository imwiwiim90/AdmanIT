# Usage

Clone the repository in your computer

```
git clone https://github.com/imwiwiim90/AdmanIT.git
```

First setup the backend. Go to `./backend/` and run `npm i`. When the packages are installed, start the api. Make sure there is nothing running on port `5000`

```
npm start
```

Do the same for the frontend. Go to `./frontend` install the dependencies and then start the app. It will run on port `3000` by default. Finally visit `http://localhost:3000`.
